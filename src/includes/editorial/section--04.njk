<h4>Analyzing data to calibrate festival operations</h4>

<p>For the 2019 festival, Smukfest and IBM teams crafted a series of queries to probe deeply into the dizzying volume of data gleaned from current and previous festival years. For instance, are Smukfest beverage sales correlated to musical genres or scheduled performances? How do bar locations impact sales? Are beverage types associated with particular performers?</p>

<p>To find these answers, IBM volunteers dove into the tremendous trove of data collected at the festival. The rich volume and variety provided teams the opportunity to examine data from multiple points of view and correlate relationships across seemingly disparate categories. IBM festival volunteers collected data by time, venue, musical genre and sales. Associating these data categories to understand product sales at bars during events and combining each data point to create dashboard visualizations enabled teams to gain evidence-driven insight to guide real-time — and future — decision making.</p>

<p>With IBM Watson technology, existing data is combined with new enriched data sources, such as motion and weather sensors. The ability of IBM Watson to handle large data sets with many different data types from IoT devices enables the Smukfest team to make instant decisions in real time. Smukfest issues digital wristbands equipped with near field communication technology to festivalgoers to provide secure, cashless transactions for ticketing, food and beverage purchases, accommodations and VIP festival access, producing nearly 750,000 cashless transactions and a goldmine of data. And with nearly every participant carrying a smartphone, the number of sensor and data points is amplified exponentially throughout the massive crowd, providing more precise data to help the team further refine its analyses. Add to these data sources Spotify playlists, identifying real-time information about favorite groups and songs, and geolocation metadata gleaned from smartphone movement to improve deployment for security and medical teams.</p>

<h4>Using data to predict inventory needs and diminish waste</h4>

<p>Festival foodies can recharge with fresh oysters and champagne, tapas and sangria, gourmet burgers and craft beer at scores of pop-up eateries, 65 bars and 600 points of sale, all paid with a flick of the wristband. The flip side of cashless abundance and convenience is an astounding profusion of food waste. In 2018, nearly 40 percent of 325,000 food items were returned after the festival, costing precious time and money.</p>

<p>To forecast 2019 product sales, the IBM team used eight different data sources and 34 data preparation steps to transform raw and granular 2018 transaction data into a clean, aggregated data set. Data about hourly and daily sales of products at bars was compared against weather data and music schedules, revealing invaluable insights about the texture of participant behavior and interactions that help organizers plan to an astounding level of granular accuracy. Using multidimensional forecasting models incorporating information from weather to sales, IBM helped Smukfest planners predict inventory needs, reducing errors that can generate over- or understocking critical products, enabling vendors to place more precise orders for inventory based on real-time conditions. The teams envision that at future festivals, bar managers will be able to depend on data and AI to provide reliable inventory recommendations — such as how many oranges to stock to keep crowds refreshed and happy.</p>
